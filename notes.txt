n 2020 (for maildroppa), I learned React in 4 weeks on my own. In the end - I developed a little component for login by using a useReducer hook.
So as a little demo of your coding skills, I would ask you to also write me something similar. Make a small prototype of an app with authentication and a private page.
No API connections or fancy styles needed.
There should be login/logout buttons. Auth state is managed by Context API, which uses reducer hook, auth token in place.



- App should consist of 2 routes.

- One route is public with the login form. Use any credentials for login.


- The second route is private with random text like “Hi Marcus’


- Persist auth state (don't drop auth state on page refresh)
